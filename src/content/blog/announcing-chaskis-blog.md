# Welcome to the Chaski Blog

In today's digital landscape, we're constantly bombarded with information. Social media platforms, driven by **engagement algorithms** and **advertising models**, often prioritize quantity over quality. This is where **Chaski** comes in - my attempt to create a more intentional and healthier way to consume online content.

## What is Chaski?

At its core, Chaski is more than just an **RSS/Atom reader**. It's a vision for a **content navigation platform** that supports:

- Multiple content types: **Articles**, **Images**, **Microblogs**, and **Videos**
- Various feed formats beyond traditional RSS/Atom
- User-curated content streams without algorithms or ads

## The Technology Behind Chaski

Built using **Tauri** (a modern framework combining **Rust** and **TypeScript**), Chaski is:

- **Cross-platform**: Runs on multiple devices
- **Lightweight**: Doesn't rely on Chromium
- **Open-source**: Fully transparent and community-driven

Current features include:

- **Synchronization** with Google Reader API-compatible services (like FreshRSS)
- **Standalone mode** for complete independence
- **Modern interface** focused on simplicity and efficiency

## The Road Ahead

Looking forward, we're working on:

- **Social media integration**: Adding support for **Mastodon** and **Bluesky**
- **AI-assisted curation**: Exploring machine learning for smarter content filtering
- **Extended feed support**: Implementing additional feed formats
- **Performance optimization**: Improving memory usage and processing speed

## Why This Matters

In an age of information overload, Chaski aims to put **you** in control of your content by removing **algorithmic manipulation** from your feed and providing a **transparent**, **open-source** alternative to commercial platforms. It's about reclaiming your digital space and creating a healthier relationship with online information.

## About This Blog

This space will serve as a **development journal** documenting our progress, a **technical resource** for contributors, and a **community hub** for discussions about content consumption. Join me in building a better way to navigate the digital world. Your thoughts, feedback, and contributions are always welcome!
